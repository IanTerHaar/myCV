        <h2>MY BACKGROUND</h2>
        <p> I’m a third-year Software Engineering student with a passion for problem-solving and technology. 
            My main focus is Java, a versatile programming language that I’ve used in various projects, from 
            robust back-end systems to interactive user interfaces.

            I believe in learning by doing and always seek opportunities to apply my theoretical knowledge to real-world problems. 
            This hands-on approach has deepened my understanding of the software development lifecycle. I’m excited about the 
            future and the endless possibilities in this dynamic field.
